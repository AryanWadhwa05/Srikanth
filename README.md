# tokenizer

This project was created for an internship with HomeSend.

The project's aim is to allow credit card numbers to be input through a system and then tokenized using a code which Masercard uses (ie. 1234 are the first 4 tokens of a card)
I then implement this into their system (not availible to public) and finish my project
